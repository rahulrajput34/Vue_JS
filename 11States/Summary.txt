// Here, We are want to use the props we gave inside the home to the QuizFooterLinks component
// So, we need to pass the props in the all the props

// But its not a good practise to do that
// There is a concpet call depedecy  injection
// We use it over here to comeour from this condition

============================>>>     First way    <<==============================
Syntaxt
==> In this concept we has the provide and inject
// we provide by giving the provide keyword and using the inject, inject it whereever we want

// This is how we provide it
provide('key', 'I am provided by the provide keyword');

//This is how we can inject it
const key = inject('key');

// TODO:
// We can also make it reactive as well
// And we change this data inside another component and its changed over here
// But we dont know which component change it
// In this case we can  also  pass the function inside the provide
// Wherever we need 
const {name, changeName} = inject('name');
we inject it like this and use it


// TODO:
// There is also a better way than this above one which is faster and simple
// This way is create the stores folder and give logic inside it and export from there
// We can also give the function in it and use it somewhere else in that project

// TODO: 
// Now another best and fast way is the using the pinia tool 
// Its better than vuex
// and also fater than importing from somewhere
// Its also has importing and but exporting but its good in term of perfomence of the code
